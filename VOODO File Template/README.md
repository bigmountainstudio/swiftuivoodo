# Xcode File Template

1. Take the folder called "VOODO.xctemplate" and put it into this directory:
    ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Custom/
2. Note: That full directory might not even exist so you will have to create it.
3. Start Xcode and create a new file. Scroll down and you should see the option appear in the "Custom" section.
